# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Phase II)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: The spec references technology names (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) in the architecture overview for context but does not prescribe implementation details. This is acceptable per the constitution's technical constraints section.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements use MUST language and are verifiable. Success criteria focus on user-facing metrics (time to complete actions, concurrent users) rather than internal system metrics.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 7 user stories cover all authentication and task management flows
- 30 functional requirements with testable criteria
- 8 success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Out of Scope section explicitly lists excluded features

## Validation Summary

| Category | Items | Passed | Failed |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 4 | 0 |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 8 | 0 |

| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **0** |

## Status

**PASSED** - Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
